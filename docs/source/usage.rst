Installation
------------

earthquakepy can be installed using pip. It's an absolute breeze. Try it!

.. code-block:: console

                $ pip install earthquakepy

Thats it! This will install the earthquakepy and other required libraries. Wasn't it easy?

Import
------

Now probably you know how to import the library. Let me just remind you.

.. code-block:: python

   import earthquakepy as ep

Although the library can be imported as anything, we will use :code:`ep` for the same throughout.
